# Diabetes-Prediction
ML model to classify diabetes types (Type 1, Type 2, Wolfram, Prediabetic) using patient health data. Includes EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

This notebook walks through an end-to-end binary classification task to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health metrics. Key steps include:

- Data cleaning & exploration
- Feature engineering
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Learned to balance classes using SMOTE
- Compared multiple models using scikit-learn
- Improved performance with hyperparameter tuning

## 📁 Dataset
Original dataset is available on Kaggle

## 📌 Note
This project is part of my portfolio as a Data Science aspirant. The goal was to demonstrate understanding of EDA, model selection, and evaluation techniques.
